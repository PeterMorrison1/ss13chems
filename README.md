# ss13chems

This project was just to try and make a tool to help myself play ss13 but I found that there were no datasets for the server I play on. I continued for a little to show people I know a _very_ basic React app that consumes data from a file.

## Status
I might pick this back up and extract data from the ss13 wiki for the server I play, but I have other projects I want to work on first. So this is effectively on an indefinite hiatus. 

## Link + Explanation
The static page for this can be accessed [here](https://petermorrison1.github.io/ss13chems/) - nothing fancy, just a "menu" browser that has tags and filter by category, when clicking the plus button it will show the recipe. 

## Running
Its the same as most react apps to run locally. You can download the files, cd to the directory in the cmd prompt, then type npm start in the cmd prompt and it should open in a browser window.
